![ETL Process via API](https://github.com/data-engineer-sk/dataWarehouse-PostgreSQL-1/blob/main/Nasdaq%20API%20-%20ETL%20Processing.png)

### Project Aims
This project aims to apply the PySpark to build a linear regression machine learning model to predict the test score for the Machine Learning Test.

### How it works
Write a CLI program with python.  Use the API function calls provided by Nasdaq.com to extract csv file.  Use packages such as  Pandas / Numpy to transform the data complie with the user requirement.  Store the results to the PostgreSQL / MysQL Server (Can be stored in local machine or AWS Cloud RDS) which act as a data warehouse.  Use SQL to furthur transform the data into a new data table (**Perform unit test to ensure the data are clearn to use in future.**)

### System Requirement
This system requires the following setting:
- Python 3.10 or above
- PySpark 
- Juypter Notebook

### Input File
Extract the historical stock data, use the API which were provided by Nasdaq.com for processing.  Use **nasdaqdatalink.ApiConfig.api_key** to establish 

### Output
Extract the historical stock data, use the API which were provided by Nasdaq.com for processing.  Use **nasdaqdatalink.ApiConfig.api_key** to establish
